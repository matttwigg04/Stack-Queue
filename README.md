# Stack-Queue
This was an assignment I completed for my Post AP Data Structures and Algorithms class 
## Assignment Details 
I had to complete the code for the necessary methods for a one stack and one queue using the respective Interface. 
I picked one node based and one array based. Finally, I wrote Tester.java that tests each of my 2 classes by 
calling all of the available methods on one instance of the object.
